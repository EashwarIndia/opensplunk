=========
- Mission goal for the project 

   Feng is targeted to be chosen as the standard log service of openstack. 

   Feng will be a Data engine, which can index the data which it receives and make it searchable via a google like search interface. Feng can provide search, analytics and visualization capabilities to data stored in your openstack environment or other storage systems. Our aim is to design a opensource, easy to use, plug and play data analytics Engine.
