Figure out an effective way for remote work, by eashwar and Denny

Guideline
=========
- update all document or data to github, before discussion.

  The purpose is to prevent knowledge missing or information outdated.

- send an email for the agenda first, before sync.

  The agenda may be a question list or a topic list. 

  It can save a lot of time for both meeting holder and attendees. And everyone can be fully prepared.
